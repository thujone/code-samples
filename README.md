Greetings RDI,

I've put together screenshots and code from my last two jobs (Presidio from 2017-2019, and Xendee from 2019-2023) that should give you a much better idea of the projects I've been working on. I've only included files that are at least 80-90% my code.

At Presidio, the Next-Generation Risk Management (NGRM) app was the project I worked on 98% of my time there. By the end, I was the lead dev on the project and running the day-to-day scrum ceremonies. The app itself allowed for cybersecurity professionals to upload company-wide penetration scans into the system and helped them organize and visualize risks, compliance, governance, and other aspects of security. It also allowed them to assign and track team resources and tasks. I've included backend and frontend code for three features: hosts, risks, and vulnerabilities. I believe it shows my ability to work across the entire stack.

For Xendee, I've included some samples from two projects. The Economic Optimizer is Xendee platform's main application and took up about 50-60% of my time at Xendee. It shows some of the larger, more complicated features that I worked on. Most of the application was .NET 4.8 MVC, but parts of it were starting to move into modern times, using .NET Core. I've included samples of my work with WebApi, as well as a few of the front end solutions I architected.

The second Xendee project is the One-Line application for generating technical schematics for building microgrids. I spent almost an entire year working on it and built the app from scratch using plain HTML (a little bit of Handlebars), plain ES6 classes, and the YWorks graphing library. It consumed about 25% of my entire time at Xendee. I also worked on a few other smaller React 17/18 and Vue applications.

Anyway, I hope the screenshots and sample code give you a little peek into what I've been busy with the last several years. Thanks for your attention, and I hope to talk again soon!

-Rich
