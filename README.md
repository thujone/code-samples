Sample Code Notes

I've put together screenshots and code from my last two jobs (Presidio from 2017-2019, and Xendee from 2019-2023). I've only included files that are at least 80-90% my code.

For Presidio, I have posted samples from the Next-Generation Risk Management (NGRM) app. I spent the vast majority of my time at Presidio working on it. It was a "slice-and-dice" application, which allowed for cybersecurity professionals to import large network penetration scans (CSV files > 250MB) into the app's database. It helped them organize and visualize risks, compliance, governance, and other aspects of security. It also allowed them to assign and track team resources and tasks. I've included backend and frontend code for three features: hosts, risks, and vulnerabilities.

For Xendee, I've included samples from two projects. The Economic Optimizer is Xendee platform's main application and took up about 50-60% of my time at Xendee. It shows some of the larger, more complicated features that I worked on.

The second Xendee project is the One-Line application for generating technical schematics for analyzing and building microgrids. We built the application from scratch using plain JS (ES2015 classes/modules and HTML5 Web Components), some Handlebars, and the YWorks graphing library. It consumed about 25% of my entire time at Xendee. I also worked on a few other smaller React 17/18 and Vue applications.
