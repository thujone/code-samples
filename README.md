Sample Code Notes

I've put together screenshots and code from my last two jobs (Presidio from 2017-2019, and Xendee from 2019-2023). I've only included files that are at least 80-90% my code.

At Presidio, the Next-Generation Risk Management (NGRM) app was the project I worked on 98% of my time there. By the end, I was the lead dev on the project and running the day-to-day scrum ceremonies. The app itself allowed for cybersecurity professionals to upload penetration scans into the company's network and helped them organize and visualize risks, compliance, governance, and other aspects of security. It also allowed them to assign and track team resources and tasks. I've included backend and frontend code for three features: hosts, risks, and vulnerabilities.

For Xendee, I've included samples from two projects. The Economic Optimizer is Xendee platform's main application and took up about 50-60% of my time at Xendee. It shows some of the larger, more complicated features that I worked on.

The second Xendee project is the One-Line application for generating technical schematics for analyzing and building microgrids. I spent almost an entire year working on it and built the app from scratch using plain HTML (a little bit of Handlebars), plain ES6 classes, and the YWorks graphing library. It consumed about 25% of my entire time at Xendee. I also worked on a few other smaller React 17/18 and Vue applications.
